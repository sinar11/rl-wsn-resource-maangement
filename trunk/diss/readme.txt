%%%%  UTA Ph.D. Dissertation Document Generation Using Tex/Latex   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     Tex/Latex is one of the widely used software to generate many technical and other 
%     documents including thesis/dissertations at many universities including UTA.
%      
%     The advantage of using Tex/Latex is that with proper style files, most of the 
%     front matter required by the university is generated with very little 
%     effort (including table of contents, copyright page, list of figures, etc.).
%     All other formatting (margins, fonts, footnote style, equation style, 
%     table style, etc.) is built into the style file. With proper style files,
%     it is possible to convert many of the material in any Tex/Latex document 
%     so that the generated output fulfills the requirements of an outside publication.
%     Many of the outside publications provide such style files for the conversion.
%      
%     The utathesis.zip contains all the sample files that are necessary to generate
%     a typical UTA Ph.D. Dissertation Document including utathesis.sty (contains
%     all the formatting required by UTA Graduate School), graphics.sty, psfig.sty
%     (to include figures that may be in the thesis), amsmath.sty (helpful in generating
%     more complex equations), two typical chapters (which contain equations, figures, and
%     tables, references), two appendices, typical dedication, acknowledgement, abstract,
%     and biographic information files. It is suggested that you unzip utathesis.zip 
%     into a new directory so that you can run utaexample.tex contained in
%     the directory to generate a sample output. The utaexample.tex is like a script file
%     which you can modify to suit individual requirements and any minor changes that
%     are required. By commenting out certain portions of the utaexample.tex, it is
%     possible to generate truncated output (just one chapter without front matter, etc.).
%
%     Any Tex/Latex Package including MiKTex (http://www.miktex.org)
%     and Convenience Tex/Latex Editors (http://www.miktex.org/links.html) may be used
%     to generate the Dissertation Document.
%
%     This utaexample.tex file was created by UTA EE Department and uses the
%     bibliography/reference style used by IEEE and adopted by EE Department.
%     The bibliography/reference file acceptable to other departments at UTA are available
%     and must be substituted in the appropriate place.
%
%     Any comments/suggestions  you may have may be sent to prabhu@uta.edu.
